Exercise 1:
    The Bella Napoli pizzeria offers vegetarian and non-vegetarian pizzas to its customers. 
    The ingredients for each type of pizza are listed below.

    Vegetarian ingredients: Pepper and tofu.
    Non-vegetarian ingredients: Pepperoni, Ham, and Salmon.

    Write a program that asks the user whether they want a vegetarian pizza or not, and based on their response, 
    show them a menu with the available ingredients for them to choose from. 
    Only one ingredient can be chosen in addition to the mozzarella and tomato that are on all pizzas. 
    At the end, the program should display whether the chosen pizza is vegetarian or not and all the ingredients it contains.
